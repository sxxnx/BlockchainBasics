# Blockchain Basics
Because I am tired of explaining blockchain to people I made this repo based on Coursera classes about blockchain

Blockchain allows peer to peer transfer of digital assets without any intermediaries  

- goods transfer (ex : supply chain)  
- digital media transfer (ex : sale of art)  
- remote services delivery (ex : travel & tourism)  
- decentralized business logic (ex : move computing to data sources)  
- distributed intelligence (ex : education credentialing)  
- distributed resources (ex : power generation and distribution)  
- crowd funding (ex : startup fund raising)  
- crowd operations (ex : electronic voting)  
- identity management (ex : one id for all your life's functions)  
- government public records (ex : open governing)  
**inclusive economy**  
Opportunities for innovative applications are **endless**  

## Bitcoin

1- Continuously workuing digital currency system  
2- Model for autonomous decentralized application (blockchain)

Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a new digital currency (cryptocurrency called Bitcoin) : enable peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority.  
If no central authority Bitcoin realized **trust and security** by implementing software programs for validation, verification and consensus in a novel infrastructure called the **blockchain**.  
Blockchain is establishing trust among unknown peers, recording the transaction in an **immutable** (you can add but not edit or remove) distributed ledger.  

### Centralized vs Decentralized network

ex : a customer wants to buy an item using his credit card : how many intermediaries for accomplishing this ?  
1- Credit card agency  
2- Customer bank  
3- Credit cards bank  
4- Exchange  
5- Merchant's bank  
6- The merchant  

This is the centralized system, how about a decentralized system ?  
Peers can transact **directly** with each other, no matter their location. Peers are not necessarily known to each other.  
But how is trust established among the peers ?   
A process is validating, verifying and confirming transactions. The transaction is recorded in a distributed ledger of blocks; creating a tamper-proof record of blocks, chain of blocks and implementing a **consensus protocol** for agreement on the block to be added to the chain.  
**Recording is immutable** which is primarly why the trust and security are established in the blockchain.  
*Imagine lending money to someone, this person may lie about the amount and may return less money, to prevent this trust violation we need to get help from the people around us by providing them a valid copy of this ledger.*  
If all of this is online, how do we trust unknown peers ? Using validation and verification.  
We request a peer to verify the amount transacted, the peer checks the amount, if it is not correct then it is not validated and the transaction is rejected.
